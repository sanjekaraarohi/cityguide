                        Khajrana Ganesha Temple is one of the most visited temples in the city because of its history and religious beliefs attached to it. The locals especially have a lot of faith in the temple and the blessings that they get from here; which in a way makes it a priority in any travellerâ€™s list. It is believed that the temple was originally built by Ahilya Bai Holkar and was later subjected to some finishing touches by different historic personalities.  According to several religious beliefs, it is said that whoever comes here and wishes for something, the wish gets fulfilled within a short span of time. That is the reason that you might see people praying at Khajrana Ganesha Temple for getting a baby or some work related problems. To add to the religious aura of the place, there is also a dargah nearby. This is dedicated to Nahar Sayed who is believed to be buried headless here. For Muslims, this place holds great religious importance and is frequented by a dozen of people every day.
