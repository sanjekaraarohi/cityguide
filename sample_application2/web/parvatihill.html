                    <h1><b>Parvati Hill!</b></h1><br>
                    <p>
                        Parvati Hill is situated in the south-east part of the city. Tthe entire place was full of fields, trees and small dwellings during the Peshwa rule. The vast plains at the foothill were often used by feudal lords and dignitaries to put their camps when they visited the city with their armies. There are numerous references of Angres-the Controllers of Coastal area of the Maratha Empire, the Scindias and other Sardars camping luxuriously at the base of Parvati hill.

When Sir Charles Mallet, the British envoy in the court of the last of the Peshwas came to present his credentials to the Maratha power, he camped at the the base of Parvati Hill for more than a week. 

After the breakdown of the Panshet water dam and subsequent devastation of parts of the city near the banks of the rivers, the entire base area of Parvati, which originally belonged to the Devdeveshwar Temple trust, was taken away by the government of Maharashtra and was used for building houses. It resulted in complete destruction of lush green fields and gave rise to the growth of slums.
