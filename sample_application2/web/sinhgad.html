                    <h1><b>Sinhagad Fort!</b></h1><br>
                    <p>
                        Sinhagad Fort is a popular picnic spot located at a distance of 25km from Pune city in Maharashtra state, India. This is a popular trekking destination for the people of Pune as it is situated on a hill, at a height of 700m above the surrounding landscape. I think most people are familiar with the fact that in Maharashtra state, you can see different forts. It is believed that Tanaji Malusare, a general in Shivaji's army sacrificed the wedding of his son to win the fort. This brave soldier was well supported by uncle Shelar Mama as well as Marathas. <br></p>
                    <p>
                        This fort was named after Kondana, after this brave Tanaji Malusare who fought like a true lion till his death. So Sinhagad fort is sometimes known as Lion fort also. When you get a chance to visit this fort, you can see that it still reflects the story of our Pune city. From this Sinhagad fort, you can also see Panshet, Khadakwasla, and Varasgaon dams as well as the Torana fort. Sometimes this fort is also used for training purposes by the National Defence Academy. Inside the Sinhagad fort you can also see the Samadhi of Tanaji Malusare with that of Shivaji's younger son Rajaram. Once, this fort was the summer house of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the great freedom fighter. You can also see Dev Taki, which is a tank famous with sweet and cold water in Sinhagad fort. <br></p>
                    <p>
                        One of the main attractions of this fort is its climbing on foot. It's better to carry some snacks with you while visiting the Sinhagad fort.
